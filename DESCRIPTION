Description: This package contains functions for plotting, and animating, the output of importance samplers, SMC samplers and ensemble-based methods. Functions for plotting and animating histograms, densities, scatter plots, time series are provided, along with a function for plotting the genealogy of an SMC or ensemble-based algorithms. These functions all rely on algorithm output to be supplied in tidy format. A function is provided to transform algorithm output from matrix format (one Monte Carlo point per row) to the tidy format required by the plotting and animating functions.
